# A-custom-Java-Library-for-Graphs
This Java project builds a graph library that includes classes for undirected, directed, and weighted graphs. It comprises key graph algorithms like as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's, and others. The project includes a demonstration of graph operations, which ensures efficient graph management and manipulation.
